"""
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

##### Solution
# Nested for loop starting from the biggest 3-digit number is used. If product of two loop counters is 
# palindrome number that number is remembered and inner loop is stopped, because another palindrome with # # same outer loop counter and smaller inner loop conter gives smaller result for sure.
